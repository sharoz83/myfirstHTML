<h1>What is dropshipping?</h1>
<p>
Drop shipping is a form of retail business where the seller accepts customer orders without keeping stock on hand.<br /> Instead, in a form of supply chain management, the seller transfers the orders and their shipment details either to the manufacturer, a wholesaler, another retailer, or a fulfillment house, which then ships the goods directly to the customer.<br />The retailer is responsible for marketing and selling a product, but has little or no control over product quality, storage, inventory management, or shipping.<br />[1] By doing this, it eliminates the costs of maintaining warehouses – or even a storefront – purchasing and storing inventory, and employing necessary staff for such functions.<br />As in any other form of retail, the seller makes profit on the difference between an item's wholesale and retail price, less any pertinent selling, merchant, or shipping fees accruing against them.
</p>

<p>A drop shipping business model does not require a brick and mortar store. It may be eliminated entirely, or combined with drop shipped order fulfillment business model. A physical retailer may keep potential drop shipped items on display, provide details on mail order items via a catalogue, or maintain a website with information available only online. A virtual retailer only has a website.
</p>

<p>Drop shipping retailers are not required to disclose the practice, nor, as with any other retailer, the wholesale source of the products they offer. This can be achieved by "blind shipping" (shipping merchandise without a return address corresponding to the seller), "private label shipping" (having merchandise shipped from the wholesaler with a return address customised to the retailer), or utilising a fulfillment house. The ultimate order fulfiller might also include a customised packing slip, including details such as the retailer's company name, logo, and contact information.
